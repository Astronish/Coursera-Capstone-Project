   1.	**Business Problem Description:**
        To open a new restaurant, the one of the most important factors which contribute to the success of any restaurant is its location.         To determine, if a person wants to open a new restaurant, this project will recommend the places where they need to open it.
        According to the CNBC report, 45% of restaurant failure is because the owner choose bad location for the restaurant.
        Poor visibility, no parking, and no foot traffic is a combination that makes it nearly impossible to turn a profit. Picking the           right location can make up for some of the other deficits in this list which include food quality, staff friendly, etc..

   2.  **Business Requirement Description:**
        To analyze and select the best locations in New Delhi, India to open a new Indian restaurant. Picking up the best location                 includes three important factors:
        a. Population Base
        b. Accessibility
        c. Parking Facility
       
        This project is timely as the city is currently suffering from the oversupplying of Indian restaurants. 

2.	**Data Resources:**
        Following are the data resources which help me in the project.
